      <description>*I began this task on 06/09/2023. I began with cloning the given task repository and I chose the Hugo theme I loved.
*Going forward with the task, I had a lots of problems which I had to face. Some of them I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve at the beginning. Due to these problems, I had to redo the task 4 times.
*At the end, I was able to find a solution to these problems and I was able to create the blog post successfully and complete task-02.</description>
